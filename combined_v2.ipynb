    "# Monte-Carlo Options Pricing: A Visualization\n",
    "While we have included more detail in the following sections, we will begin with a brief overview of what our project aims to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- TODO: This is literally just the pasted abstract we submitted with the proposal. -->\n",
    "Our project addresses the challenge of understanding how uncertainty and randomness affect the price of options in finance. Pricing options requires estimating the expected future value of an asset, a task that becomes analytically intractable when the option has complex features or many sources of uncertainty. Monte Carlo simulations are a powerful technique to approximate option prices by simulating many potential future price paths, but their stochastic nature can make them difficult to grasp.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our visualization aims to bridge this gap. Users will be able to simulate option pricing based on adjustable parameters like volatility, drift, interest rate, time to expiration, and number of simulation paths. As paths evolve visually, a convergence plot will dynamically show the option price estimate stabilizing. This will be plotted against the Black-Scholes model, a widely used formula for pricing options, highlighting the convergence of Monte Carlo simulations to the underlying price.\n",
    "\n",
    "By making this probabilistic process tangible, our tool will help viewers develop intuition for how uncertainty propagates into financial valuations. The final deliverable will be a web-based interactive visualization combining stochastic process simulation with real-time data plots to deliver an experience that demystifies the use of Monte Carlo simulations in option pricing."

    "# Basics of Options Pricing\n",
    "For our final project, we will be visualizing how Monte Carlo simulations are used to price options.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin with some explanations. Options are a financial contract that give the buyer the *right* (but not the obligation! hence the name \"option\") to buy or sell an asset at a specific price, the **strike price**, before the option's **expiration date**. There are two main kinds of options: **call options**, which let you buy an asset at the strike price before the expiration date, and **put options**, which let you sell an asset at the strike price before the expiration date.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say you want to buy a call option with a strike price of `$110` that expires in 1 month on Pepsi stock, which is currently worth `$100`. How would you price this option? If you pay `$10` for the option, you are hoping that Pepsi stock will be worth more than `$110` in 1 month, so that you can buy it at `$110` and sell it for more than you paid for the option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we buy this option for `$10`. If Pepsi stock goes up to `$135` in 1 month, you can use the option to buy it at `$110` and then sell it for `$135`, netting you a profit of `$135` (what you sell it for) - `$110` (the strike price you buy at) - `$10` (the price of the option) = `$15`. You can see that the option is now worth`$15`, so it is a good deal!\n",
    "\n",
    "However, assume that Pepsi stock goes down to `$90` in 1 month. If you bought the option, you would not use it, because you could just buy Pepsi stock for `$90` - there's no reason to buy it at the option's strike price of `$110`. In this case, the option is worthless, and you would have lost the `$10` you paid for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, when buying an option, we seek to only buy it if we think that *on average* the option will return a profit above the price of buying it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- TODO: Should this be an interactive visualization of how this can go? -->\n",
    "\n",
    "Pricing options is important for both buyers and sellers of options. For buyers, it allows them to figure out if an option is a good deal and thus whether they can make a profit on it. For sellers, it allows them to figure out how much to charge for an option, i.e. the \"fair price\"."

What if we didn't have the coin, or were dealing with a more complex set of variables?

For example, if we were to randomly draw a number greater than 1 from the normal distribution when trying to estimate the probability of heads, we would reject it, because we know the probability of heads being greater than 1 is 0."

If we have two path simulations, then we are looking at two possible futures, etc etc. The more simulation paths that we observe, the more data we will have to analyze, and the more complete of a picture we will have prediting the future. A simple way we can see this is with the law of large numbers, which states that the more data we have, that dataset's mean will be closer to the true mean of whatever we are sampling. So, in our example, the more paths we have, the better an estimate of the stock's future value we will have.\n",

With more iterations, we get a more accurate distribution, just as a longer time to expiration gives the stock price more chances to impact an option’s value."

HV is important because it serves as a benchmark for IV, helping traders assess if an options IV over or under priced. In Monte Calro simulations, IV determines the likelihood of the option expiring In The Money (ITM) or not. Because options do not require you to exercise your right to buy or sell at any time, if IV is high, the stock has a greater chance of hitting the strike price before the option expires. In other words, more large fluctuations means you have a higher chance of the stock reaching a value where you can return a profit before the option expires. \n",
